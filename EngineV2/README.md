# New engine

## Intro

This project was started and some things were fixed or added, but...

## Sad news

Originally this files were in a different folder and without git and I just carried the folder to this reposotory.  
The problem is that some things GitHub didn't like and my other commits to fix it didn't help, so I tried to undo this commits and just add it again.  
However, my idiotism took control and didn't move the files from folder and the reset of git deleted all files I added and there is so much that recovery is too hard to do.  
So, I added original files of my school project and I start anew 🙃
