# Old engine

## Intro

Well, this is my project for one of my courses in university and my first try at making an engine. This was easier then I thought it would be, but the engine is not that good, some code works, but I don't like it. The main problem of this project is yhat it was made unedr strict and short deadline, while I had other things to do. So I decided to make a V2 version on my own time with out any time limits.

## Sad news

Originally this files were in a different folder and without git and I just carried the folder to this reposotory.  
The problem is that some things GitHub didn't like and my other commits to fix it didn't help, so I tried to undo this commits and just add it again.  
However, my idiotism took control and didn't move the files from folder and the reset of git deleted all files I added and there is so much that recovery is too hard to do.  
So, I added original files of my school project and I start anew 🙃
