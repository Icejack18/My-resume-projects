# My-resume-projects

## Destription

All the work that I am okay to post for future job interviews and my LinkedIn profile.
Basically, this reposotory is my resume or/and my blog about my achivements in programming.
It also will have only projects I am proud to share, so no "Hello world" programs which you can find right after start up of the code editor.

## Story time :D

At the moment (9.12.2024) I am a first-year-university-student that is trying to make his way into the world of game development. With that said, let me tell you a bit about journey until now and then I will tell what are my plans.
The idea of programing video games came to me some time ago, but let me start a bit before this happended... 

When I moved to Finland and started my education in information technology. I still had only vague idea of what I want to do if my first choice of profession didn't come to pass (Not coding, but not now). It was hard to start on my path, because I didn't know anything beside the fact that coding is interesting and I am good at figuring out how somethings work (aka algorithms, how I found out later, people call it). So, after some thinking I decided that I just need to start my education in this area and my future will be clear to me as I go forward.

Unfortunately, I just wasted a lot of my time studying things that are not as useful to me as I thought they would be. The longer my journey was, the more uncertain I became in what I want in my life. I tried a bit of web development, a bit of just random programming in different languages and finally I decided what I want. Games! Also hacking, but I never got to do it..yet. The idea of trying to "sneak" into the castle that other people created and help them make it more safe is amazing, but that's not the point

Never the same tasks and never ending challenges that await me in game creation sounded delightful. No limits to the imagination and nothing is impossible, if you work hard enough. And so I began my studies, but I never could find my way in to this path and after not fast enough results with one method I tried to find another way in without much success. 

That's until now...

I finally made something that I am a bit proud of. it is not that great at the moment but I finally have enough knowledge and experience to build something to show. The idea came to me after I thought about terminal games that were played long time ago, when there were no art in most games beside ASCII art. I desided to make a game like this as my project for programming course and it is here!

I made this game and didn't have enough time to make it like I imagined it fully, but basic concept is there I will make it into short game with (probably) 10 minutes of gameplay, unless I get stuck in my desire for improvement and make it into second Undertale (basic game and I already have a big head)

## Plans for the future (10.12.2024)

I will add a lot more to this repo and hope one day this work will help me in finding job. I will make some games for this repo and some projects that will not even connected to games. Right now I will work on my first game and make it more interesting. Add some healing, power-boosts and other stuff like different enemies.
